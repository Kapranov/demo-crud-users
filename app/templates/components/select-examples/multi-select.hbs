<h3>Multiple select</h3>
<p>
  Setting `multiple=true` will put the menu into multi-select mode. Selected options are displayed as pills that can be individually removed. When in multi-select mode, 'on-change' sends an array of objects as an argument, rather than a single object.
  When combined with new item creation (below), searchable-select can be used as a tagging UI component.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    {{searchable-select
      content=TEDevents
      sortBy="title"
      multiple=true
      prompt="Choose events"
      on-change=(action "update")}}

    <p>Set by Searchable:</p>
    <ul>
      {{#each setBySearchable as |selection|}}
        <li>{{selection.title}}</li>
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
